# 6 Cybersecurity Certifications Worth Exploring in 2025

With 34 years of experience in information security and multiple certifications under my belt, including CCISO, CEHIv8, and GDPR, I've learned that not all certifications are created equal. Some open doors, others just take up space on LinkedIn.

Let me share which certifications are really worth the investment of time and money to build a solid cybersecurity career.

## Why Certifications Matter

Cybersecurity certifications usually take time and cost a lot of money. But when chosen correctly, they can be your weapon to get the career and salary you deserve.

They're not just letters on a profile. They're proof of knowledge, credibility, and commitment to continuous learning in a rapidly changing field.

## 1. CompTIA Security+ — The Starting Point

**What it is:** A globally recognized entry-level certification that proves you know the fundamentals of network security, compliance, threats, and risk management.

**Who it's for:** Beginners or those transitioning to cybersecurity from another field. Two years of IT administration experience is recommended, ideally with a security focus.

**Why it's valuable:** No formal prerequisites — just interest in cybersecurity and basic IT knowledge. Covers a wide range of fundamental topics, making it a great first step before more advanced certifications. Recognized by employers worldwide.

Security+ is a great starting point and is considered a good "general" certification. Employers know and respect it. If you're just starting out, this is my number one recommendation.

## 2. (ISC)² CISSP — The Gold Standard

**What it is:** The Certified Information Systems Security Professional offered by the nonprofit organization (ISC)² is one of the most sought-after certifications in the field. Achieving CISSP is one of the most prestigious certifications in the area, covering advanced security architecture, risk management, and organizational security practices.

**Who it's for:** Experienced professionals — often those targeting leadership roles like Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or security manager. It's a lot of work, but recruiters will notice.

**Why it's valuable:** Widely considered the gold standard for cybersecurity expertise. Requires at least five years of paid full-time work experience in at least two of the eight CISSP Common Body of Knowledge domains. Globally recognized as proof of deep knowledge and leadership skills.

You'll need dedication. This isn't a casual weekend project — you'll need to dedicate serious study time. Plus, you should already have years of real-world experience to pass. But if you're aiming for leadership or policy roles, CISSP is essential.

## 3. GIAC GSEC — For IT Professionals

**What it is:** The GIAC Security Essentials Certification is about proving you understand information security beyond just buzzwords. Covers defense in depth, cryptography, authentication, and more.

**Who it's for:** IT professionals who want to orient themselves in security or expand their skills.

**Why it's valuable:** Vendor-neutral, meaning it applies to any environment. Great mid-level certification for those who want to back up their practical skills with recognized credentials. No prerequisites, but practical experience in IT or security helps.

GSEC, along with Security+, is a great option for IT workers who want to explore a career in cybersecurity. Provides education on topics like network security and incident response. If you work in IT but want to get into security, this is an excellent choice.

## 4. Offensive Security OSCP — For Ethical Hacking

**What it is:** The Offensive Security Certified Professional is a practical, highly respected penetration testing certification. Known for its intensive 24-hour exam, where you must hack vulnerable machines and document your findings.

**Who it's for:** Aspiring or active penetration testers, red team members, or anyone who wants to prove their real hacking skills.

**Why it's valuable:** Focus on practical skills, not just theory. Teaches you to think like an attacker, which is perfect for building strong defenses in the future. Globally recognized by employers as one of the most challenging and respected ethical hacking certifications.

OSCP is not beginner territory. You'll need solid knowledge of networks, Linux, and scripting before attempting it. If you're serious about penetration testing, consider OSCP. This certification is highly desired by red team members. If you're looking for practical and offensive security work, this is for you.

## 5. ISACA CISA — For Audit and Compliance

**What it is:** The Certified Information Systems Auditor focuses on IT auditing, control, and assurance. Offered by the professional IT organization ISACA, don't confuse the certification with the government agency Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. This program is ideal for ensuring systems are secure and compliant with regulations.

**Who it's for:** IT auditors, compliance professionals, and anyone working in governance or risk. CISA is a great certification for those who want an advanced career in these fields.

**Why it's valuable:** Globally respected in industries that depend on regulatory compliance, such as finance, healthcare, and government. Emphasizes identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring systems meet required standards. Requires five years of work experience in information systems auditing, control, or security (with some substitutions allowed for certain academic degrees).

If you want to enter cybersecurity auditing as a career, achieving a CISA should be a goal. If you're interested in compliance and auditing, this certification is essential.

## 6. GIAC GCIH — For Incident Response

**What it is:** The GIAC Certified Incident Handler proves you can detect, respond to, and resolve cybersecurity incidents. Shows you understand offensive operations and therefore can formulate great defenses.

**Who it's for:** Security professionals who want to focus on incident response and handling breaches.

**Why it's valuable:** Teaches you to manage live cyber attacks, from malware detection to hacker countermeasures. Recognized by employers who need incident response talent in high-pressure environments. No formal prerequisites, although practical experience in security operations is highly recommended.

The GCIH certification is known to be challenging, but proper preparation can make a big difference. Knowing basic security practices and Windows command line will help a lot. If you want to work on the front lines, this is an excellent choice.

## Which Certification is Right for You?

While you should do more research before investing time and money in these certifications, here are quick recommendations based on different career goals:

**Just starting out?** CompTIA Security+

**Work in IT but want to get into security?** GIAC GSEC

**Aiming for leadership or policy?** (ISC)² CISSP

**Interested in compliance and auditing?** ISACA CISA

**Want to work on the front lines?** GIAC GCIH

**Looking for practical and offensive security work?** Offensive Security OSCP

## Think Beyond the Badge on LinkedIn

Cybersecurity certifications aren't just about adding letters to your online profile. They're about building knowledge, credibility, and trust in a rapidly changing field.

As someone who has gone through multiple certifications over 34 years of career, I can say that the real value isn't in the certificate itself, but in the learning process and the community you become part of.

If you're a student, changing careers, or an experienced professional, one of these six could be your next big career move. Choose wisely, dedicate yourself to study, and use the knowledge gained to make a real difference in information security.

## Final Reflection

Certifications are an investment. An investment of time, money, and energy. But when chosen correctly and pursued with dedication, they can transform your career.

Don't seek certifications just to have them on your resume. Seek those that truly expand your knowledge, open professional doors, and prepare you for the real challenges of the cybersecurity world.

At 60, I continue learning and certifying. Because in information security, stopping learning is stopping being relevant. And these six certifications are excellent paths to stay relevant and valuable in the market.
