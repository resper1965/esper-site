# Online Safety at 60: Protecting Yourself in the Digital Age

I've learned that online safety isn't about complicated technology — it's about creating good habits, just like locking your front door or fastening your seatbelt. Let me share what really works.

As someone who works in security, I see daily how scammers exploit vulnerabilities. But I also know that with some simple precautions, you can protect yourself effectively.

## The World Changed, But Principles Remain

Back then, scammers tried to make you buy fake watches or play a rigged three-card game. Now, scammers use emails, text messages, and phone calls to pressure you into paying, often with gift cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrencies.

The difference is the medium, not the intent. And protection follows the same logic: be suspicious, verify, don't rush.

## Identify Scams Before They Identify You

Treat any unexpected and urgent request with suspicion, even if it seems to come from someone you know. If someone demands unusual payment, it's a scam — it's not rude to hang up immediately.

Scammers are masters at creating false urgency. "Your account will be blocked in 24 hours", "Your grandson is in jail and needs money", "You won a prize but need to pay a fee first". Everything urgent, everything fake.

The rule is simple: if it's too urgent for you to think, it's a scam. No legitimate person needs you to decide in seconds.

## Verify Independently

Back then, you'd confirm a request by calling a neighbor or your bank. Now, criminals spoof caller IDs, create fake websites, and even use AI voice clones.

If you suspect a scammer is targeting you, don't respond immediately. Pause and contact a trusted source directly. Look up a phone number on an official website instead of using the link in a fraudulent email. Use the phone number you already know, not the one someone gave you.

Received an email from your bank asking for something? Call the number on your card, not the one in the email. Someone called claiming to be from Microsoft? Hang up and call the official support yourself. It's simple, but it works.

## Think Before You Click

Back then, junk mail went straight to the trash. Now, dangerous links in emails, messages, or ads can infect your device instantly.

If you didn't expect it, don't click links or respond — don't even click the "Unsubscribe" button. That can confirm your email is valid and active, generating more spam.

The golden rule: if you didn't ask for it, don't click. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. If it creates artificial urgency, it's suspicious.

## Keep Devices Updated

Back then, you'd change your locks if you lost a house key. Now, software updates keep you safe. They fix security flaws and protect against hackers.

Enable automatic updates whenever possible. Yes, it can be annoying to have to restart your computer or phone, but it's much less annoying than having your data stolen.

Think of updates as preventive maintenance. You change your car's oil regularly, right? Updates are the same thing for your devices.

## Use Strong Passwords (And a Manager)

Back then, you used a four-digit bank PIN at the ATM. Now, criminals use powerful tools to guess short passwords.

A strong password should be at least 16 characters, unique to the account, and include a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. But here's the secret: you don't need to memorize them all.

Use a password manager program. It's like having a digital safe that stores all your passwords. You only need to remember one master password, and the program takes care of the rest. Bitwarden, 1Password, LastPass — they all work well. Choose one and use it.

## Protect Your Privacy

Back then, you kept some things to yourself. Now, oversharing on social media can give criminals the clues they need to steal your identity, like your birth date and address.

Share carefully, and revisit your privacy settings regularly. Social media changes settings frequently, so it's worth checking from time to time.

Think before you post. That birthday photo with the date visible? Can be used for identity theft. Real-time check-in showing you're traveling? Can be used for physical theft. You don't need to stop using social media, just use it consciously.

## Cybercrime Is Invisible, But You Can Protect Yourself

Back then, you could see a break-in or the empty garage where your stolen car was. Now, cybercrime is often invisible. Clicking a bad link may seem harmless, but hidden malware can steal data for months without you noticing.

You can be deceived and only realize it months later. That's why prevention is everything. Don't wait for something to happen to protect yourself.

## You Have the Power to Stay Safe

Online safety isn't about fear. It's about awareness. By understanding how threats have changed, you can take simple steps to protect yourself and your loved ones.

You don't need to be a technology expert. You just need to create good habits, just like you already do in other areas of life. Locking the door, verifying before trusting, not rushing into important decisions.

## Practical Tips That Work

Start simple. Enable two-factor authentication on important accounts — bank, email, social media. It's an extra layer of protection that's really worth it.

Use different passwords for each important account. If one is compromised, the others remain safe. A password manager makes this easy.

Be suspicious of urgency. No legitimate person needs you to decide in minutes. If it's too urgent, it's suspicious.

Always verify. Received something suspicious? Call the official source using a number you already know, not the one they gave you.

Keep everything updated. Automatic updates are your friends. Leave them enabled.

## Final Reflection

I see online safety as a natural extension of the physical safety we already practice. It's not complicated, it doesn't need to be scary. It's just about creating good habits and maintaining awareness.

As a father, I protect my daughters. As a security professional, I protect organizations. As someone navigating the digital world, I protect myself with the same principles: be suspicious, verify, don't rush.

You have the power to stay safe online. Start today, one step at a time. Every habit you create is one more layer of protection.
